FairBid utilizes Internet Computer blockchain to record every transaction securely, providing transparency and immutability.



## Key Features

### Multiple Auction Formats
FairBid caters to different auction preferences by offering various formats:
- English Auction: Price starts low and increases until the last bidder remains.
- Dutch Auctions: Start with a high price that decreases over time until a bid is made.
- Sealed-Bid Auctions: Participants submit private bids, with the highest bidder winning the auction.

### Seamless ETH Integration
- ETH Deposits and Credits: Deposit ETH into FairBid and use it as FairBid Credits with zero fees.
- Withdrawals: Withdraw funds to Ethereum as ETH or to the Internet Computer as ckETH, ensuring flexible asset management.
- Credit System: Our innovative credit system supports fee-free transactions, enhancing the user experience.

### Advanced Auction Customization
- Scheduled Auctions: Users can schedule auctions in advance, providing better planning and participation.
- Whitelist Management: Sellers can restrict participation to a select group of bidders using customizable whitelists.

### Internet Identity
FairBid integrates Internet Identity, a decentralized identity management solution, to ensure secure and seamless user authentication.






To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd fairbid_v1/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.



### Note on frontend environment variables
- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
